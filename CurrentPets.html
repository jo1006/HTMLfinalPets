<!-- inline CSS ********** -->

<p><strong><em>SNOWBALL & SALLY: 10 weeks old, spayed female domestic shorthairs, 4 lbs. (Snowball) and 5 lbs. (Sally)</em></strong></p>
<br>
<p>If you’re looking to bring some love and joy into your home, look no further than these two girls. They’re 10-week-old 
rescues—amazingly sweet and loving. They’re affectionate (big-time purrers and cuddlers), playful, and endlessly entertaining </p>

<br>
<p>They are healthy, have had their shots, been spayed, and are litterbox trained.<p>
<br>
<p> They’ve bonded to each other, so we’d like to keep them together.</p>

<h3 class="right">Astro Loves People</h3>

<p><strong><em>Astro: 2 years old, neutered male, domestic shorthair, 11 lbs</em></strong></p>
<br>
<p>Astro can thank his lucky stars, because after a car hit him, he made it out of the vet hospital in Springfield and
found a temporary home with us. Astro’s a little nervous, but once he settles down, he loves people to pet him. He’s lean 
and lanky, and even though we think he’s fit to run a kitty marathon, he weighs almost 12 pounds!</p>
<br>
<p>Astro is a sweetheart, but he’s very scared right now. Come meet with him and see what a great guy he can be. 
Maybe you can give him his forever home! </p>
<br>
<p>For information about Astro, call Jessica at Pets to Go: (555) 555-5555.</p>

<h3 class="left">A High-Energy Bundle of Fun</h3>

<!-- inline CSS ********** -->

<p><strong><em>CINDY: 3 years old, spayed female, Shepherd mix, 40 lbs.</em></strong></p>
<br>
<p>Cindy came to us because her family was splitting up. She’s never gotten the attention a young dog needs.</p>
<br>
<p>Cindy is super playful. She loves toys, and her favorite game is fetch. She’s a smart cookie and adapts well to positive 
training. She already knows “sit,” “down,” “stay,” “shake,” and “sit pretty,” and she’s learning more fun tricks like “roll over.” 
Cindy is house-trained, rides well in the car, and enjoys being brushed and groomed. She behaves well around the house and respects
her boundaries.</p>
<br>
<p>This special girl needs an adult-only home with people who have experience with large dogs, so she can continue to develop 
into a well-adjusted dog. Cindy needs someone who’ll give her very clear rules, lots of love, and plenty of exercise. In return, 
she’ll be your loyal friend for life.</p>
